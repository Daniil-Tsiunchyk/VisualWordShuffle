## Overview

VisualWordShuffle aims to provide a visual demonstration of how the readability of words is maintained even when their internal letters are shuffled, provided that the first and last letters remain in place. This project is inspired by a fascinating linguistic theory and serves as a hands-on experience in web interface development.
